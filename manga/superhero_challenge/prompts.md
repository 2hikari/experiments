Panel 2 Prompt: Comic panel 2, continuing from image_0.png in the same art style and setting. The superhero now looks incredibly nervous, looking down at his feet with sweat drops on his forehead, his hands anxiously gripping the edges of his cape. The girl on the bed leans forward slightly, her expression shifting from surprise to intense anticipation. A speech bubble above the superhero reads, "...It's really embarrassing."

Panel 3 Prompt: Comic panel 3, same art style and setting. The superhero has stooped down slightly and sheepishly pulled up the blue pant legs of his costume to just below his knees. Revealed beneath the bulky torso are ridiculously skinny, pale, twig-like calves and ankles, contrasting sharply with his upper body. The girl's eyes are wide, her jaw dropped in sheer disbelief, staring at his legs. There is no dialogue, just the visual reveal.

Panel 4 Prompt: Comic panel 4, same art style and setting. The girl is now slouching on the bed, looking completely unimpressed and disappointed, with one hand over her face in a facepalm gesture. The superhero stands awkwardly, still exposing his skinny legs, gesturing defensively with one hand. A speech bubble coming from the girl says, "You skip leg day?" A smaller, jagged speech bubble from the distressed superhero says, "I FLY everywhere, okay?!"

 **Story Arc:** The "Wrong Address" (Visual Comedy)

  **Panel 2 Prompt:**
  A comic book panel in the style of a modern US superhero cartoon, cel-shaded with bold lines. Inside a pink bedroom, the superhero (blue spandex suit, red V-logo, red cape) pauses mid-speech, looking confused and holding up a crumpled piece of paper from his belt. He is no longer looming, but standing awkwardly. The young girl (long dark hair, pink shirt, blue jeans) sitting on the bed looks less scared and increased confusion, tilting her head. Background details: framed posters, teddy bears on bed, pink rug.
  **Speech Bubble:** From Hero: "...Wait. Is this 124 Maple Avenue?"

  **Panel 3 Prompt:**
  A comic book panel, close-up shot of the characters. The superhero's face shows wide-eyed realization and embarrassment (sweat drop effect). The girl looks deadpan/unimpressed and points her thumb towards the open window behind her. Lighting is bright and clear.
  **Speech Bubble:** From Girl: "This is 126. Maple is next door."

  **Panel 4 Prompt:**
  A comic book panel, wide angle shot of the bedroom. The room is now empty of people. The pink curtains on the window are blowing wildly inward, indicating a rapid exit. Only a single red superhero boot is visible just disappearing out of the window frame. The girl is sitting alone on the bed, staring blankly at the window. The mood is comedic silence.
  **Speech Bubble:**  Jagged shout bubble from outside the window: "YOU SAW NOTHING!"
