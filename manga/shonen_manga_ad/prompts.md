The prompt:
``` 
**Task:**
Design a manga concept that has the highest potential to become the *most popular series* in a Japanese weekly shōnen manga magazine.

You must produce **two outputs**:

### Output 1: Compact Narration

Write a **concise, compelling narration** that explains the manga’s core idea.

* Assume the audience is a general reader unfamiliar with the story
* Focus on the hook, emotional core, and why it resonates with shōnen readers
* Keep it short enough to be read aloud in under 20 seconds

### Output 2: Image Generation Prompt (for Nanobanana)

Create a **single prompt** that instructs Nanobanana to generate a **full-color, one-page manga advertisement** introducing the series.

* The image should feel like a *magazine splash page*
* Clearly convey genre, tone, main character(s), and central conflict
* Do NOT generate the image yourself — only output the prompt text
``` 

Response from thinking, Gemini 3.0:

``` 
To create a series with "most popular" potential, we need to blend the high-stakes "death game" tension of modern hits with the classic "underdog" emotional core.

The concept is **"Echo Protocol."** It targets the current shōnen trend of high-concept supernatural action where the protagonist's power comes at a devastating personal cost.

### Output 1: Compact Narration

"In a world where your lifespan is currency, the elite buy immortality while the poor trade years of their lives for a single day of food. Haru, a boy with zero years left, discovers a forbidden power: he can manifest the 'Echoes' of fallen warriors. But there’s a catch—every time he uses their strength, he loses a piece of his own memories. It’s high-octane action where every victory makes him forget why he’s fighting. Can he topple the system before he forgets who he is?"

### Output 2: Image Generation Prompt (for Nanobanana)

> **Prompt:** A professional, full-color manga splash page advertisement for a new Weekly Shōnen magazine series titled "ECHO PROTOCOL." The central figure is a teenage boy with messy black hair and glowing blue eyes, lunging forward in a dynamic, high-angle action pose. He wields a translucent, ethereal katana made of shimmering blue "memory" particles. Ghostly, towering silhouettes of legendary samurai and futuristic soldiers loom behind him like "Echo" stands. The background is a high-contrast split between a gritty, neon-lit cyberpunk slum and a pristine, golden futuristic city in the clouds. Bold, stylized Japanese kanji and English text for the title "ECHO PROTOCOL" are integrated into the composition. The art style is sharp and modern, reminiscent of Tite Kubo or Yusuke Murata, with vibrant blue energy sparks and cinematic lighting. A tagline at the bottom reads: "How much of yourself will you sacrifice for power?"

**Would you like me to develop the specific "Echo" abilities for the main cast or outline the major story beats for the first ten chapters?**

The only way is down, and he’s bringing the whole city with him."
