The prompt:
``` 
**Task:**
Design a manga concept that has the highest potential to become the *most popular series* in a Japanese weekly shōnen manga magazine.

You must produce **two outputs**:

### Output 1: Compact Narration

Write a **concise, compelling narration** that explains the manga’s core idea.

* Assume the audience is a general reader unfamiliar with the story
* Focus on the hook, emotional core, and why it resonates with shōnen readers
* Keep it short enough to be read aloud in under 20 seconds

### Output 2: Image Generation Prompt (for Nanobanana)

Create a **single prompt** that instructs Nanobanana to generate a **full-color, one-page manga advertisement** introducing the series.

* The image should feel like a *magazine splash page*
* Clearly convey genre, tone, main character(s), and central conflict
* Do NOT generate the image yourself — only output the prompt text
